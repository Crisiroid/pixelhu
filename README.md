## 🧠 How It Works

Each pixel is represented as a colored square in a grid.  
When the user taps on a pixel:
1. The pixel’s color updates to the selected color.
2. The app stores the grid state in memory.
3. On “Save,” the grid is converted into a PNG image using a screenshot or bitmap capture.

## 💡 Inspiration

Pixelhu aims to bring that magic to your phone, making it easy and fun to create retro-style art anytime.
